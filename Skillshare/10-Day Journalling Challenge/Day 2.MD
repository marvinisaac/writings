# Day 2: Today I Decided

Today I decided to start working on a game about life.

One of the main influences is Torn, an online game I enjoy playing daily.

It only requires a few minutes which is something I like.

Another is The Sims, a simulation game in the PC.

I always enjoyed creating houses in it so I'm thinking of adding a similar feature.

Another is Animal Crossing, a game I have yet to play.

I want to create a life simulation that's as realistic, but also as short, as possible.

Or maybe something with the theme "the last days" where your character only has few days left.

I want to write a story and possible earn some money this way.

I also want to dabble in game making, script writing, and environment building.

I plan on releasing an HTML5 preview with the full game downloadable in Google Play.
