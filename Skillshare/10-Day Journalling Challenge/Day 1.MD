# Day 1: Today I Noticed

Today I noticed how much I get irritated by too much noise.

It's as if the voices inside my head are not enough, not loud enough, to for me to go deaf.

The weird thing is I also hate complete silence. I hate having nothing to listen to except my own thoughts.

At first it 's okay but as time goes on, my mind wanders to places I'd rather not go to, places I want to avoid.

I remember a time when I can't stand a minute without music.

When I'd sleep with my ear plugged with a pair of earphones with music blasting as loud as possible.

I remember the feeling of despair when my MP3 player's batteries dies.

I hated the sound of people talking, of vehicles moving around, of birds singing their own song.

I seek the solace of familiar songs, of familiar feelings, and familiar stories.

"So do you prefer silence or noise?", you might ask and, to be honest, I don't know how to answer you.

Maybe a happy medium between the two?
